# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
In this project I was tasked with creating a an Instagram page primarily to test my knowledge and ability of CSS styling and layout. CSS techniques were applied to achieve a design that functions across different devices. 

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I felt slightly hesitant about using Flexbox and Grid to structure the elements. These techniques helped in aligning my content which boosted my confidence in my ability. 
- **Responsive Design**: I was able to style all elements confidently after applying the theory I had learnt.
- **Styling Elements**: I was also able to style the page in a manner of my choosing without too much of a problem.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I was unsure if adjusting the formatting for smaller screens would work however it was less of a challenge than I thought it would be. 
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: Implementing these effects were more challenging than I had anticipated and I require more practise using them.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I would like to better understand advanced CSS properties to better my quality of work
- **Code Optimization**: Although my code performed as expected, I would liked to have been more creative with the styling.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I ensured that my webpage looked as close as possible to the Instagram layout as possible.

#### Overall Learning Experience
This project allowed me to stretch my mind and get stuck in with CSS. I look forward to more tasks similar to this.
